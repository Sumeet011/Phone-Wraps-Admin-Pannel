# Environment Variables

## Required Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Backend API URL
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-api.com

# Optional: Environment
VITE_ENV=production
```

## Development

For local development, use:

```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000
VITE_ENV=development
```

## Important Notes

- Never commit the `.env` file to version control
- All environment variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be accessible in the app
- Restart the development server after changing environment variables
- For production deployment on Vercel, add these variables in the Vercel dashboard
